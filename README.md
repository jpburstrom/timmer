# Timmer

Music for double bass and electronics

**Timmer** is a project to investigate the musical potential in a digital music medium, where the music is changing every time you play it back. More specifically, it's researching the connection between musical improvisation and generative algorithms.

The songs are still in progress. They are the numbered files in `player/`. In `player/songs/` you'll find the raw recordings.
